The goal is a working model that can detect multiple 3D objects and provide their dimensions and orientation given a photo. There are many ways to implement this, but this project uses center-based 3D object detection and tracking, where the model predicts the physical, three-dimensional center of detected objects, which is regressed to predict the dimensions and orientation of the object.
