The dataset contains 30 features. Feature elimination algorithms like Recursive feature elimination (RFE) and Univariate feature selection (UFS) algorithm were used for dimensionality reduction. The results showed that ensemble classifiers give a much better prediction accuracy than a single strong classifier with less number of features.,Python,189,610

oguzcanbekar/hakan_1,1,2,2020-08-06T14:06:17Z,"Neural Networks have revolutionised the healthcare industry by introducing Deep Learning models that reach human-level accuracy. In this work, a pipeline implementation is explored that tries to enhance the accuracy of Deep Learning models in the detection and segmentation of pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographs. This is done in the hopes of facilitating future applications in the medical field. By cascading a CNN and a U-Net, we ensure that the CNN will filter out all the cases with no pathology, i.e.’Normal’ cases, leaving the U-Net (trained on positive cases only) to focus on arranging a set of filters for the separation of pathology from the infected lungs. The models are cross validated on the same data to ensure consistency. The proposed method demonstrates higher accuracy in both segmenting and detecting the pathology. By implementing it with more complex architectures and integrating in the domain knowledge of radiologists, this methods can be applied in conjunction with other applications to rapidly triage and prioritise cases for the presence of anomalies.",Jupyter Notebook,286,37567

Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables they are considering, and the number of independent variables getting used.",Python,127,7

The main aim of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model that allows to anticipate the purhcases that will be made by a new customer, over the next year according to its firsts purchases.  The notebook was developed by performing the next steps: Data Cleaning. Feature Exploration. Understanding Product Categories. Customers Categories. Classifying Customers. Testing Predictions. Explaining The Decissions of The Model. Say Hello to KModes for Categorical Clustering A brief introduction to an algorithm for categorical clustering is thaught in the process of developing an accurate customer segmentation",Python,213,47
