chanship72/finance,0,2,2017-11-28T08:05:30Z,We have used the phishing website database for comparing a strong classifier like SVM with ensemble classifiers like AdaBoost and Voting classifier. The dataset contains 30 features. Feature elimination algorithms like Recursive feature elimination (RFE) and Univariate feature selection (UFS) algorithm were used for dimensionality reduction. The results showed that ensemble classifiers give a much better prediction accuracy than a single strong classifier with less number of features.,Python,14,610

The main aim of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model that allows to anticipate the purhcases that will be made by a new customer, over the next year according to its firsts purchases.  The notebook was developed by performing the next steps: Data Cleaning. Feature Exploration. Understanding Product Categories. Customers Categories. Classifying Customers. Testing Predictions. Explaining The Decissions of The Model. Say Hello to KModes for Categorical Clustering A brief introduction to an algorithm for categorical clustering is thaught in the process of developing an accurate customer segmentation",Python,0,47

The goal is a working model that can detect multiple 3D objects and provide their dimensions and orientation given a photo. There are many ways to implement this, but this project uses center-based 3D object detection and tracking, where the model predicts the physical, three-dimensional center of detected objects, which is regressed to predict the dimensions and orientation of the object.

It allows you to train models with a novel distributed SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm named Grouping-SGD. A new parallelization scheme named GSP (Grouping Synchronous Parallel) is used in Grouping-SGD for distributed deep learning on heterogeneous clusters. ,C++,3,2119
